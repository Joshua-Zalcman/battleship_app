# Battleship Game

![game_screen](img/game_screen.png)

This is an early project of mine that is a simplified version of the game "Battleship". The functionality is written entirely in Vanilla JS. Player has the option of choosing Hard or Easy mode (game will detect a "hit" and search in that area vs. game will  pick tiles randomly ). The Player can also toggle light or dark mode and if the player or computer get to go again after a "hit".
